# Scenario:

#### 

"You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members."

# Question to Analyze:

 
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

# About the Analysis: 

**Hypothesis:**  Member uses bike share service to go to work, while casual riders use it for enjoyment.

**Analysis Process:** In order to better understand the behavior of the two bike user types, I focused on how long the trip took and how often users rode. Divided by group (casual and member) I got insights of how they behave during days of the week. Demographics was also part of the analysis. I checked for the busiest station throughout the year. 

**Conclusion:**  Members indeed use bike share service more often and more constantly during weekdays than Casual riders. 

Casual riders use the service for a long period of time during weekends.


I would say: There is a strong argument to verify the hypothesis as true.
